# Jack's house poem
Made with `open::<dylan>`

This exercise is about the video ["Nothing is
something"](https://youtu.be/OMPfEXIlTVE?si=dVrhJkZARB7xCSk4&t=1019)
made in RailsConf 2015 by Sandi Metz.

In this video there is a poem ["This is the house that Jack
build"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_the_House_That_Jack_Built)
where the computer creates the poem from a list of phrases and little
by little, new requirements are added to the program.
